<h1>Spanish Fry</h1>
<p>I'll get my kit! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Ooh, name it after me!</p>
<h2>Fear of a Bot Planet</h2>
<p>Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Fatal. We're also Santa Claus! She also liked to shut up! Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. It must be wonderful.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.</li>
    <li>When will that be?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mother's Day</h3>
<p>Is the Space Pope reptilian!? OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!</p>
<h4>Put Your Head on my Shoulder</h4>
<p>Shut up and take my money! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! But existing is basically all I do! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</li>
    <li>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?</li>
    <li>Belligerent and numerous.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Jurassic Bark</h5>
<p>I can explain. It's very valuable. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? They're like sex, except I'm having them! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!</p>
